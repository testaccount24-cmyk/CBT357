  The STRING macro is functionally similar to the COBOL DISPLAY
  or PL/I PUT EDIT instructions.

  Using STRING, you can concatenate any number of fields, edit
  each of them if necessary, and get the result in the work area
  you specify.

  Formats:

    (1) label  STRING {field_specification1}
                      {,field_specification2}...
                      ,INTO=workarea|(workarea,length)
                      {,PRINT=GEN|NOGEN}

    (2) label  STRING GENERATE
                      {,PRINT=GEN|NOGEN}


  field_specification

    Each field to be printed is described as a positional
    operand.  Each operand specifies the field address, its
    length, and its formatting requirements.

    Four field description formats are supported:

      1.   symbol
      2.   (symbol,length,format)
      3.   (d(r)|(r),length,format)
      4.   ((r),,format)
      5.   'character string'

  Symbol specifies the field address.  It must be an
    S-type (relocatable) address.

  d(r) may be used to specify the field address in S/370
    base-displacement format.  If d is zero, it may be omitted.
    If d(r) or (r) is used, length must also be specified.  R14
    and R15 may not be used.  If d(0) is used, it is handled the
    way the assembler does, i.e. R0 as a base register is assumed
    to contain zero: 16(0) is equivalent to 16, CVTPTR or, X'10'.

  ((r),,format) specifies that (r) contains the value
    itself, not an address.  R14 and R15 may not be used.

  'character string' specifies a literal enclosed in single quotes
    as specified in a DC instruction.  Hex strings or character
    strings are supported.  The following expressions are equivalent:
    'ABC' C'ABC' X'C1C2C3'

  Length specifies the length and/or the type of the input field.
    It may be specified as an integer, a symbol, a register, or a
    constant.  When used with symbol, it overrides the assembled
    length and/or type.  Length is required if field is specified
    as d(r) or (r).  If a zero length is specified, the field is
    ignored.

        nn   field length in bytes
        H    half-word
        F    full-word
        FL1  1-byte binary integer
        FL3  3-byte binary integer
        P    packed field
        (r)  length of character string (R0 thru R12)
        d(r) length of character string (R1 thru R12)

  Notes:  If the field address is specified as a symbol that
          has been defined previously in the program, the symbol
          type is known and there is no need to specify it.

          If the length is specified as (r) or d(r) and the value
          is greater than the address itself, (r) or d(r) is
          considered to be the end address +1 instead of the length.

          The length is not specified for packed fields.  The
          @STRING subroutine scans the field left-to-right until it
          finds a byte with a valid sign in the low-order 4 bits.

          If symbol is an arithmetic expression and no length is coded,
          the implicit length will be that of the first symbol in the
          expression;  for example, if symbol is coded as PSATOLD-PSA,
          then the implicit length will be L'PSATOLD.

          All numeric items are assumed positive.

  format  optionally indicates editing options that must
          be applied to a field.

      L        left justified
      R        right justified
      nn       output length
      0        adjust length
      Z        leading zeroes
      B        leading/trailing blanks
      T        truncate character string after last non-blank
      X        display in hexadecimal
      YYMMDD   convert julian date to YYMMDD
      YY/MM/DD convert julian date to YY/MM/DD
      DD/MM/YY convert julian date to DD/MM/YY
      MM/DD/YY convert julian date to MM/DD/YY
      YYYYMMDD convert julian date to YYYYMMDD
      YYYY-MM-DD convert julian date to YYYY-MM-DD

    The default format depends on the field type:

        Type                   Default Format

        character string             L
        FL1                          R3B
        H or FL2                     R5B
        other numeric fields         R7B

    Note: L0 and T are equivalent for character strings.

  'character string' is any character string enclosed in
  single quotes.  Blank spaces may be specified as nnX,
  where nn is the number of X'40' bytes you want to be
  inserted in the output line.  %TIME may be specified to
  obtain the current time in hh.mm.ss.hh format.

INTO=workarea|(workarea,length)

  INTO indicates the address and length of the output work area
  into which the result of the concatenation should be placed
  (left justified).  If the work area is too small, truncation
  will occur.  If it is too large, it is padded with blanks.

  The address may be a symbol, d(r) (S-type address) or (r).

  The length may be specified as an integer, a symbol, a register,
  or a constant; it is required if the address is coded as d(r) or
  (r).  If length is not specified for a symbol-type address, the
  assembled length of the symbol is used.

  Upon return from STRING, R15 contains the length actually used
  in the output work area (before padding).

PRINT=GEN|NOGEN

  This operand allows you to temporarily override the PRINT
  specification (GEN or NOGEN).

GENERATE (format 2)

  The GENERATE format must be specified once at the end of the
  program.  It generates the @STRING sub-routine as well as all
  the literals specified in previous invocations of the macro.

  The GENERATE format allows the specifications of the
  AR_MODE, NO_CSECT and LOCTR options.

         STRING GENERATE<,AR_MODE<,LOCTR>>>
                          NO_CSECT

  The following combinations are valid:

         STRING GENERATE
         STRING (GENERATE,NO_CSECT)
         STRING (GENERATE,AR_MODE)
         STRING (GENERATE,,LOCTR)
         STRING (GENERATE,AR_MODE,LOCTR)

  The AR_MODE option can be specified to generate a
  @STRING module that supported AR mode.  Example:

         STRING (GENERATE,AR_MODE)

  The NO_CSECT option can be specified to indicate that the
  @STRING module should not be generated; only the literals
  are generated in this case.  Example:

         STRING (GENERATE,NO_CSECT)

  The @STRING CSECT contains optional functions (such as %TIME or
  julian date conversion) that are only generated if they have
  been specified in the previous invocations of the STRING macro.

  To generate of a @STRING CSECT that supports all of the optional
  functions, two STRING GENERATE macros must be specified:

         STRING (GENERATE,NO_CSECT)        Generate Literals
         STRING GENERATE                   Generate CSECT

Examples:

     STRING 'ERROR===>',LINE1,'<=== POS ',((R6),,L0),INTO=WORKAREA

     STRING 8X,C'ERRORS FOUND: ',(ERRORS,,L0),INTO=((R7),44)

     STRING 'CVT ADDR IS ',(CVTPTR,4,X),X'40C1C2C3C4',INTO=LINE

     LA    R5,WORK+16              end addr +1
     STRING 'R4=',((R4),,X),INTO=(WORK,(R5)),PRINT=GEN

     STRING '//JOBLIB DD DSN=',(DSN1,,T),',DISP=SHR',INTO=((R2),72)

     PUT31 SYSLIN
     LH    R0,SYSLIN+82            LRECL
     STRING '   NAME  ',(4(R3),8,T),'(R)',INTO=((R1),(R0))

     STRING GENERATE         Generate literals and sub-routine


Programming Notes:

  A STRING macro generates only 6 bytes that need to be covered by
  base registers.  More code is generated at the end of the
  current CSECT (using LOCTR pseudo instruction), but this code
  does not require addressability.  This is particularly useful
  when STRING calls specify a large number of literals.

  Additionally, STRING does not use A-type constants (ACON), but
  S-type constants (SCON) which require symbols to be addressable
  at the point in the program where STRING is issued.

  While this reduces the number of base registers required to
  cover the program's code and makes it easier to write reentrant
  programs, it will produce assembly errors in the following
  situations:

  a.  STRING is used in more than one CSECT in the same assembly

  b.  the CSECT in which STRING is used is longer than 64K

  c.  symbols are not addressable at the point in the program
      where STRING is issued

  d.  the $STRING symbol (generated in the $LTORG LOCTR during the
      GENERATE invocation of the STRING macro) is not addressable
      in some of the STRING calls.
