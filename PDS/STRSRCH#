 STRSRCH Macro

    The STRSRCH macro provides a rapid string search that returns the
    position of the search pattern within the target string, or returns
    a zero if the search pattern does not occur in the target string.

        |                                                                   |

        |          {MAXPAT integer} {MAXTRG integer}                        |
        |                                                                   |

 pattern         This alpha field or literal is the value for which to search.

 pattern-length  This numeric field or literal is the length of the pattern for
                 which to search.  It does not necessarily have to specify the
                 entire defined length of the pattern field.  It may be less
                 than that length, and only the specified number of characters
                 will be considered.

 target          This alpha field or literal is the target string that is to be
                 searched.

 target-length   This numeric field or literal is the length of the target
                 string.  As with the pattern-length, it does not necessarily
                 have to specify the entire defined length of the target field.
                 If it is less than that length, only the specified number of
                 characters will be considered.

 position        This numeric field is where the result of the search is
                 returned.  A zero indicates that the pattern was not found in
                 the target string.  Any other value indicates the position in
                 the target string where the first character of the pattern
                 occurs.

 MAXPAT integer  This keyword parameter specifies the maximum possible size in
 (Optional)      characters of the search pattern.  Its default is 64.

 MAXTRG integer  This keyword parameter specifies the maximum possible size in
 (Optional)      characters of the target string.  Its default is 4096.

                 MAXPAT and MAXTRG are used to define storage and need not be
                 changed unless the maximum possible field sizes are greater
                 than the defaults.


 Operation -     STRSRCH generates no output and can be used alone or in
 INLINE          conjunction with other routines and/or EASYTRIEVE PLUS logic.

 Operation -     No changes in the specification of parameters are required to
 Data Base       use STRSRCH with data base files.  For files with variable
                 length records, the EASYTRIEVE PLUS defined field RECORD-LENGTH
                 may be used for the "target-length" parameter, unless  you do
                 not wish to search the entire input record.

                 J. Strother Moore and discussed in their article "A Fast String
