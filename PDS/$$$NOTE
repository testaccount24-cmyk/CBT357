  This is File 357 from the CBT Tape.  These are all freeware and       FILE 357
  may be used, changed or included without restriction.                 FILE 357
  Comments, problem reports or suggestions are always welcome.          FILE 357
                                                                        FILE 357
  Some changes have been made to facilitate installation.  The          FILE 357
  @XALLMEM member is set to change the dummy file and job               FILE 357
  information to whatever you desire via either ALLMEM or               FILE 357
  XALLMEM.  The @LOADLIB member is an unload of the load module         FILE 357
  PDS for ease of loading (and for those without PL/I compilers).       FILE 357
                                                                        FILE 357
  Programs with assembly/compile/link JCL are in their member           FILE 357
  names, i.e. UNTOUCH is the code and compile JCL; a suffix of $        FILE 357
  has sample run JCL, i.e. UNTOUCH$ is the execution JCL.  Each         FILE 357
  program and its associated JCL has its name as the ISPF ID            FILE 357
  statistic.  The REXX macros have an ID of REXX and CLIST macros       FILE 357
  CLIST to allow easier separation.  Assembler macros specify an        FILE 357
  ID of MACRO.                                                          FILE 357
                                                                        FILE 357
  All programs now have documentation in @PGMDOC# and almost all        FILE 357
  executables have built in help as well as formal external             FILE 357
  documentation in @MACDOC#.  The documentation files are ASCII         FILE 357
  carriage controlled.  The documentation has been revised with         FILE 357
  another clean up.  The original input to ADDCC for both the           FILE 357
  macro and program documentation has been included as @MACDOCO         FILE 357
  and @PGMDOCO as requested to allow anyone to easily change them       FILE 357
  for local use.                                                        FILE 357
                                                                        FILE 357
  The available programs are written in Assembler, COBOL and            FILE 357
  PL/I.  For those non PL/I shops, check with your System Support       FILE 357
  folks; you may be surprised to find there's a "free" older            FILE 357
  level out there.  PDSGAS has been eliminated since it                 FILE 357
  apparently has some quirks and many folks are now going to            FILE 357
  PDSE's.  Changed programs are shown below with a tilde (~); new       FILE 357
  ones with a plus (+) The programs are:                                FILE 357

    ~ ADDCC to add carriage control to a sequential file with           FILE 357
      some text descriptors like a table of contents, useful            FILE 357
      for keeping documentation reasonably easily maintained            FILE 357
      and still producing neat output - changed to make first           FILE 357
      carriage control always a ' ' and allow comments (PL/I)           FILE 357
                                                                        FILE 357
