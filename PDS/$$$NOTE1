Sam,

This version of File 357 has 30 new REXX EXEC's plus several
fixes/updates.  It also has a new program plus a few changes.
As before, all the macros plus the programs have full formal
documentation in @MACDOC# and @PGMDOC#.   I'd been asked to
provide the input to these documents in the pseudo scripted tag
format and have done so.

$$$NOTE and @FILE357 have been completely revised.  There should
be 177 members in all.

Thanks again!
                                                      Carl Hafner
